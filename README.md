# LastResort
A Lethal Company mod that allows players to explode themselves.


Be careful how you use it... other players/enemies can get caught in the explosion!
<h2>How to use</h2>

Players will only be able to explode themselves after the ship has landed and settled onto a moon. It may take a few seconds but players will be prompted when self-explosion is ready.

Default button is the F11 key, but it can be changed by modifying LastResort's config file ("../BepInEx/config/LastResort.cfg").


This mod is server-sided, all players in the server should have this mod installed for the best experience.
